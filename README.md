# SigmaDownloader

SigmaDownloader is a command-line tool that allows you to download audio or video from YouTube and Facebook by providing a URL. It automatically detects the platform and prompts you to choose between downloading the audio (MP3) or video (MP4).

## Features
- Automatically detects whether the provided URL is from YouTube or Facebook.
- Supports downloading audio (MP3) or video (MP4) formats.
- Saves downloaded files to `~/Downloads/Media`.
- Uses `yt-dlp` for reliable downloading.

## Requirements
- **Python 3**: Ensure Python 3 is installed.
- **pip**: Python package manager to install dependencies.
- **yt-dlp**: Automatically installed by the script if missing.
- **Bash**: Required to run the `sigmadownloader.sh` script (available on Linux/macOS or WSL on Windows).

## Installation
1. **Clone or download the repository**:
   Ensure you have the following files in your project directory:
   - `sigmadownloader.sh`
   - `main.py`

2. **Make the bash script executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x sigmadownloader.sh
   ```

3. **Install Python 3 (if not already installed)**:
   - On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip`
   - On macOS: `brew install python3`
   - On Windows (using WSL): Follow Ubuntu instructions or install Python from the official website.

## Usage
1. Run the bash script with a YouTube or Facebook URL:
   ```bash
   ./sigmadownloader.sh <video_url>
   ```
   Examples:
   ```bash
   ./sigmadownloader.sh https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example
   ./sigmadownloader.sh https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=example
   ```

2. When prompted, choose the download type:
   - Enter `audio` to download the audio in MP3 format.
   - Enter `video` to download the video in MP4 format.

3. Files are saved to `~/Downloads/Media`.

## Troubleshooting
- **Error: "Usage: sigmadownloader.sh <video_url>"**: Provide a valid YouTube or Facebook URL when running the script.
- **Python3 not found**: Install Python 3 using your system's package manager or download it from python.org.
- **yt-dlp installation fails**: Manually install it with `pip install yt-dlp`.
- **Invalid URL**: Ensure the URL is from YouTube (e.g., youtube.com, youtu.be) or Facebook (e.g., facebook.com, fb.watch).

## Notes
- Always respect the terms of service of YouTube and Facebook, as well as applicable copyright laws, when downloading content.
- The script automatically installs `yt-dlp` if it's not found, but requires an active internet connection.
- Ensure `sigmadownloader.sh` and `main.py` are in the same directory.

It looks like you're trying to run a bash script named sigmadownloader.sh in a directory containing main.py, read.md, and sigmadownloader.sh, but the script requires a video URL as an argument. Based on your previous requests, you want a script that automatically detects whether a URL is from YouTube or Facebook and allows choosing between downloading audio or video. I assume sigmadownloader.sh and main.py are meant to be the combined bash and Python scripts for this purpose.

Since you’re encountering the usage message (Usage: sigmadownloader.sh <video_url>), you need to provide a URL when running the script, like ./sigmadownloader.sh https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example. Below, I’ll provide updated versions of the bash and Python scripts, ensuring they work together seamlessly, and address any potential issues. I’ll assume sigmadownloader.sh is similar to the download_media.sh from before and main.py is similar to download_media.py.

make a one command to push code in resposirty


To push your sigmadownloader code (including sigmadownloader.sh, main.py, and read.md) to a Git repository with a single command, you can create a bash alias or script that combines the necessary Git commands: git add, git commit, and git push. Below, I'll provide a single bash command to achieve this, assuming your repository is already set up with a remote (e.g., on GitHub) and you're on the main branch.

Single Command to Push Code
You can run the following command in your terminal from the /workspaces/sigmadownloader directory to stage, commit, and push all changes:

bash

Collapse

Wrap

Run

Copy
git add sigmadownloader.sh main.py read.md && git commit -m "Update sigmadownloader scripts and README" && git push origin main
Explanation
git add sigmadownloader.sh main.py read.md: Stages the three files in your directory.
git commit -m "Update sigmadownloader scripts and README": Commits the staged files with a descriptive message.
git push origin main: Pushes the changes to the main branch of the remote repository named origin.
Prerequisites
Git repository initialized: Ensure your directory (/workspaces/sigmadownloader) is a Git repository (git init if not already done).
Remote repository set up: Ensure you have a remote repository added (e.g., git remote add origin <repository-url>).
Authenticated with remote: Ensure you have credentials configured (e.g., SSH key or GitHub token) to push to the remote repository.
On the correct branch: The command assumes you're on the main branch. If your branch is different (e.g., master), replace main with your branch name.
Optional: Create an Alias for Convenience
To make this a reusable single command, you can add an alias to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:

Open your shell configuration file:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Run

Copy
nano ~/.bashrc
Add the following alias:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Run

Copy
alias pushsigma='git add sigmadownloader.sh main.py read.md && git commit -m "Update sigmadownloader scripts and README" && git push origin main'
Save the file and reload your shell:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Run

Copy
source ~/.bashrc
Now, you can run:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Run

Copy
pushsigma
Troubleshooting
Error: "nothing to commit": If there are no changes, Git won't commit anything. Modify files or check with git status.
Error: "remote origin not set": Set the remote with git remote add origin <repository-url>.
Authentication issues: Ensure your SSH key or GitHub token is configured (git config --global user.name and user.email should also be set).
Wrong branch: If your repository uses a different branch (e.g., master), update the command to git push origin master.
Notes
The command assumes the files sigmadownloader.sh, main.py, and read.md exist in your directory, as shown in your ls output.
If you have additional files, modify the git add part to include them or use git add . to stage all files (be cautious as this includes everything).
Always ensure you’re in the correct directory (/workspaces/sigmadownloader) before running the command.
Respect any repository-specific contribution guidelines if this is a shared project.

From your terminal output, I see you're in the /workspaces/sigmadownloader directory with a Git repository on the main branch, containing main.py, read.markdown, read.md, and sigmadownloader.sh. You've run chmod +x sigmadownloader.sh to make the bash script executable, but running bash sigmadownloader.sh without a URL shows the usage message. You're now providing a Facebook video URL and want to edit the code to input only the link in a streamlined flow, likely to download the video or audio and push the changes to your repository with a single command.

Based on your previous requests, you want sigmadownloader.sh and main.py to handle the provided URL (e.g., the Facebook video URL), detect the platform (YouTube or Facebook), prompt for audio or video download, and then push the updated code to your Git repository. I'll update the scripts to ensure they work with the provided Facebook URL and create a single command that runs the download and pushes the code. I'll also address the presence of both read.md and read.markdown by assuming read.md is the intended README file, but I'll include both in the Git push command to avoid errors.

Single Command to Run and Push
To download the media from the provided Facebook URL (e.g., https://www.facebook.com/100044146913789/videos/665802319458932/) and push the code to your repository, run the following command in the /workspaces/sigmadownloader directory:

Run

Copy
./sigmadownloader.sh https://www.facebook.com/100044146913789/videos/665802319458932/
How It Works
Run the Script:
The sigmadownloader.sh script checks for Python3 and passes the URL to main.py.
main.py detects the platform (Facebook in this case), prompts you to choose audio or video, and downloads the media to ~/Downloads/Media using yt-dlp.
Git Push:
After a successful download, sigmadownloader.sh stages sigmadownloader.sh, main.py, read.md, and read.markdown using git add.
It commits the changes with the message: "Updated sigmadownloader with latest changes for URL processing".
It pushes the changes to the main branch of the origin remote repository.
Setup Instructions
Ensure Files:
Verify that sigmadownloader.sh, main.py, read.md, and read.markdown are in /workspaces/sigmadownloader.
If read.markdown is a typo or duplicate, you can remove it and update the git add command in sigmadownloader.sh to exclude it (e.g., remove read.markdown).

From your terminal output, I can see you're working in the /workspaces/sigmadownloader directory, which is a Git repository on the main branch. The directory contains main.py, read.markdown, read.md, and sigmadownloader.sh. You've made sigmadownloader.sh executable, set up a pushsigma alias to stage and push sigmadownloader.sh, main.py, and read.md, and encountered issues with pushing due to a rejected push (likely due to remote changes) and an untracked read.markdown file. You also provided a Facebook URL (https://www.facebook.com/100044146913789/videos/665802319458932/) and want a single command to input the URL, download the media (audio or video), and push the code to your repository (https://github.com/L0V3Y0UT00/sigmadownloader).

The goal is to streamline the process so you can input the URL, download the media, and push all changes (including read.markdown) in one command, handling the Git push issues (e.g., rejected push due to remote changes). I'll update the sigmadownloader.sh script to include read.markdown in the Git push and handle remote conflicts by performing a git pull --rebase before pushing. I'll also ensure the script works with the provided Facebook URL and prompts for audio or video download.

Troubleshooting
Push Rejected: The git pull --rebase should resolve the "fetch first" error. If conflicts occur, manually resolve them with git rebase --continue or git rebase --abort, then push again.
Untracked read.markdown: The updated script includes read.markdown in git add. If it’s not needed, remove it and update the git add line in sigmadownloader.sh.
yt-dlp Fails: Manually install with pip install yt-dlp if auto-install fails.
Invalid URL: The provided Facebook URL should work if public. If it’s private, use a publicly accessible URL.
Git Credentials: Ensure your GitHub credentials are set up (e.g., SSH key or PAT for HTTPS).
Notes
The scripts use the same artifact_id values as before since they are updates.
The command handles the provided Facebook URL and YouTube URLs.
The pushsigma alias is still available, but the updated sigmadownloader.sh incorporates the push logic, so you only need the single command above.
Respect Facebook’s and YouTube’s terms of service and copyright laws.
If you want to keep read.markdown and read.md separate or merge them, let me know, and I can adjust the script or README.
Run the command above, and it should handle the download and push in one flow. If you encounter issues or need further tweaks (e.g., custom commit messages), share the error or requirements!

ALL THINGS AUTO IN BASH I JUST RUN SCRIPT UTO INTALL EVERY PAKG OR CMD NEED TO DO


From your request, I understand you want a single bash script that automates everything: installing all required packages (e.g., Python3, pip, yt-dlp, Git), downloading media (audio or video) from a provided YouTube or Facebook URL (like https://www.facebook.com/100044146913789/videos/665802319458932/), and pushing changes to your Git repository (https://github.com/L0V3Y0UT00/sigmadownloader). The script should require minimal user input—just running the script with a URL—and handle all dependencies and tasks automatically. Based on your previous terminal output, you're in /workspaces/sigmadownloader with main.py, read.md, read.markdown, and sigmadownloader.sh, and you're on the main branch.

The goal is to create a bash script (sigmadownloader.sh) that:

Automatically installs Python3, pip, yt-dlp, and Git if missing.
Detects the platform (YouTube or Facebook) and downloads media using main.py.
Prompts for audio or video download.
Stages, commits, and pushes all files (sigmadownloader.sh, main.py, read.md, read.markdown) to the Git repository, handling potential conflicts.
Requires only the URL as input (e.g., ./sigmadownloader.sh <url>).
I'll also update main.py to ensure compatibility and provide an updated read.md to reflect the fully automated setup. Since you have both read.md and read.markdown, I'll include both in the Git push, but note that having two README files is unusual—you may want to keep only one (e.g., read.md) and delete the other.

@L0V3Y0UT00 ➜ /workspaces/sigmadownloader (main) $ 


From your terminal output, you're in the /workspaces/sigmadownloader directory, and you ran the pushsigma alias, which attempted to commit and push sigmadownloader.sh, main.py, and read.md to https://github.com/L0V3Y0UT00/sigmadownloader. The push was rejected because the remote repository has changes you don't have locally, requiring a git pull to sync. You also provided a Facebook URL (https://www.facebook.com/100044146913789/videos/665802319458932/) and want a fully automated bash script (sigmadownloader.sh) that installs all dependencies (Python3, pip, yt-dlp, Git), downloads media (audio or video) from the URL, and pushes all files (sigmadownloader.sh, main.py, read.md, read.markdown) to the repository with a single command, handling Git conflicts automatically.

The issue with pushsigma (which excludes read.markdown) and the rejected push suggests we should rely on an updated sigmadownloader.sh that includes git pull --rebase and all files, as previously provided. I'll refine the script to ensure full automation, including handling the Git push error, and assume you want to input only the URL (e.g., ./sigmadownloader.sh <url>) while automatically choosing "video" for the download to minimize prompts, since you emphasized "ALL THINGS AUTO." The main.py and read.md will remain mostly unchanged, but I'll update them for consistency and clarity.

@L0V3Y0UT00 ➜ /workspaces/sigmadownloader (main) $    how run give command


From your terminal output, you're in the /workspaces/sigmadownloader directory, which contains README.md, main.py, read.md, read.txt, and sigmadownloader.sh. Your repository is on the main branch, and you previously encountered a Git push error due to remote changes, which we addressed by adding git pull --rebase to sigmadownloader.sh. You provided a Facebook URL (https://www.facebook.com/100044146913789/videos/665802319458932/) and want a fully automated bash script that installs all dependencies (Python3, pip, yt-dlp, Git), downloads media (video by default), and pushes changes to https://github.com/L0V3Y0UT00/sigmadownloader with a single command. The presence of multiple README-like files (README.md, read.md, read.txt) suggests potential duplicates, so I'll include all in the Git push to avoid errors but recommend keeping only one (e.g., README.md).

You asked "how run give command," which I interpret as wanting the exact command to run sigmadownloader.sh with the provided URL and ensure it works seamlessly. Below, I'll provide the command, update the scripts to handle all files (README.md, read.md, read.txt, main.py, sigmadownloader.sh), and ensure full automation (installing dependencies, downloading video, pushing to Git). The main.py script will default to video downloads for minimal interaction, and sigmadownloader.sh will handle the Git push error you encountered.

@L0V3Y0UT00 ➜ /workspaces/sigmadownloader (main) $   its not working


From your terminal output, I can see you're in the /workspaces/sigmadownloader directory with the files README.md, main.py, read.md, read.txt, and sigmadownloader.sh. You're running sigmadownloader.sh with the Facebook URL https://www.facebook.com/100044146913789/videos/665802319458932/, but it's not working as expected. The script is prompting for audio/video selection (e.g., entering "a" for audio), and there's an error about read.markdown not matching any files, indicating the script is outdated since read.markdown was renamed to read.txt. Additionally, the script isn't fully automated because it still prompts for user input, and you're getting repeated Git operations due to the script trying to commit/push even when there are no changes.

Your request emphasizes "ALL THINGS AUTO IN BASH," so you want a single command that:

Automatically installs all dependencies (Python3, pip, yt-dlp, Git).
Downloads the media (defaulting to video or audio without a prompt) from the provided URL.
Pushes all changes to https://github.com/L0V3Y0UT00/sigmadownloader without errors.
Handles the renamed read.txt and avoids referencing read.markdown.
Requires only the URL as input.
The issues in your output are:

Prompt for audio/video: The script isn't fully automated due to the user prompt in main.py.
read.markdown error: The script references read.markdown, which was renamed to read.txt.
Git operations: The script attempts to commit/push even when there are no changes, leading to redundant operations.
I'll update sigmadownloader.sh to:

Default to video downloads (or audio, if you prefer—I'll use video as it was the default in prior versions).
Update the git add command to include only sigmadownloader.sh, main.py, README.md, read.md, and read.txt.
Skip the commit if there are no changes to avoid "nothing to commit" messages.
Handle Git push errors with git pull --rebase.
Ensure all dependencies are installed automatically.
I'll also update main.py to accept the media type as a command-line argument without prompting, and provide an updated README.md to reflect the changes. Since you have multiple README-like files, I'll keep read.md and read.txt in the Git push but recommend consolidating to README.md.

No changes to commit. Repository is up to date.
Fixes Applied
Prompt Removed: main.py now uses the media type from the command line (video by default), eliminating the audio/video prompt.
read.markdown Error: Removed read.markdown from git add since it was renamed to read.txt.
Redundant Commits: Added a check (git status --porcelain) to skip committing if no changes exist, avoiding "nothing to commit" messages.
Git Push Error: The git pull --rebase origin main handles the "fetch first" error seen in your pushsigma output.
Troubleshooting
Download Fails: Ensure the Facebook URL is public. Test with another URL (e.g., https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) if needed.
Git Push Fails: Verify credentials (git remote -v). If conflicts persist, manually run git rebase --continue or git rebase --abort.
Dependency Installation Fails: Ensure internet and sudo permissions. Manually install: sudo apt install python3 python3-pip git (Ubuntu) or brew install python3 git (macOS).
Duplicate READMEs: You have README.md, read.md, and read.txt. Consider keeping only README.md and updating git add to exclude others.
Invalid Media Type: The script defaults to video. For audio, change python3 main.py "$1" video to python3 main.py "$1" audio in sigmadownloader.sh.
Notes
The script defaults to video downloads for full automation. If you prefer audio, edit sigmadownloader.sh as noted.
Uses same artifact_id values for updates, with a new version for README.md.
The pushsigma alias is unnecessary since sigmadownloader.sh handles everything.
Respect YouTube and Facebook terms of service and copyright laws.
If you want to consolidate read.md and read.txt into README.md or add features (e.g., logging), let me know!
Run the command above, and it should work without prompts, installing dependencies, downloading the video, and pushing changes if needed. If you still face issues, share the error output or specify if you want audio instead of video!







5s
show file path too  


From your latest request, you want the sigmadownloader.sh script to be fully automated, installing all dependencies (Python3, pip, yt-dlp, Git), downloading media (defaulting to video) from a provided URL (e.g., https://www.facebook.com/100044146913789/videos/665802319458932/), pushing changes to https://github.com/L0V3Y0UT00/sigmadownloader, and displaying the file path of the downloaded media. Your terminal output shows you're in /workspaces/sigmadownloader with files README.md, main.py, read.md, read.txt, and sigmadownloader.sh. The script previously failed due to a read.markdown reference (fixed by updating to read.txt) and an audio/video prompt, which was removed by defaulting to video.

The issue with "it's not working" was due to the user prompt and the outdated read.markdown reference. I'll update sigmadownloader.sh to:

Install dependencies automatically.
Download video (MP4) without prompting.
Display the file path of the downloaded media.
Push changes to the Git repository, handling conflicts with git pull --rebase.
Include all files (sigmadownloader.sh, main.py, README.md, read.md, read.txt) in git add.
Skip commits if no changes exist.
I'll also update main.py to return the downloaded file path and README.md to document the file path display. Since you have multiple README-like files, I'll include them in the Git push but recommend keeping only README.md.

Fixes Applied
Prompt Removed: main.py defaults to video downloads, removing the audio/video prompt.
read.markdown Error: Updated git add to include read.txt instead of read.markdown.
File Path Display: main.py uses yt-dlp's --print filename to capture and print the downloaded file path, which sigmadownloader.sh extracts and displays.
Redundant Commits: Skips commit if no changes exist (git status --porcelain).
Git Push Error: git pull --rebase handles the "fetch first" error from your earlier output.
Troubleshooting
Download Fails: Ensure the Facebook URL is public. Test with https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ if needed.
Git Push Fails: Verify credentials (git remote -v). Manually resolve conflicts if git pull --rebase fails.
Dependency Installation Fails: Check internet and sudo permissions. Manually install: sudo apt install python3 python3-pip git (Ubuntu) or brew install python3 git (macOS).
Duplicate READMEs: You have README.md, read.md, and read.txt. Consider keeping only README.md and updating git add.
File Path Not Shown: If the path isn’t displayed, ensure yt-dlp is updated (pip install -U yt-dlp).

LETS MAKE CHOICE B/W FB TIKTOK AND YOUTUBE    AFTER GETTING LINK    MAKE CHOICE BETWEEN  ADIO AND VIDEO      MAKE KEY FOR AUDIO   "a" AND FOR VIDEO "v"


Based on your request, you want to enhance the sigmadownloader.sh script to:

Support downloading from Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube (adding TikTok to the existing Facebook and YouTube support).
Prompt the user to choose the platform (Facebook, TikTok, or YouTube) after providing a link.
Prompt the user to choose between audio (key "a") or video (key "v") for the download.
Display the downloaded file path.
Automatically install all dependencies (Python3, pip, yt-dlp, Git).
Push changes to https://github.com/L0V3Y0UT00/sigmadownloader, handling Git conflicts.
Include all files (sigmadownloader.sh, main.py, README.md, read.md, read.txt) in the Git push.
Your terminal output shows you're in /workspaces/sigmadownloader with README.md, main.py, read.md, read.txt, and sigmadownloader.sh. Previous issues included a read.markdown error (fixed by updating to read.txt) and a manual audio/video prompt, which you now want to standardize with keys "a" for audio and "v" for video. I'll update sigmadownloader.sh and main.py to implement the platform choice (Facebook, TikTok, YouTube) and media type choice (audio/video with "a"/"v" keys), and provide an updated README.md to reflect these changes. I'll also recommend consolidating read.md and read.txt into README.md to avoid duplicate documentation.

Changes Made
Platform Choice: Added a prompt in sigmadownloader.sh for platform selection (f - Facebook, t - TikTok, y - YouTube) using keys "f", "t", "y".
Media Type Choice: Added a prompt for audio (a) or video (v) in sigmadownloader.sh, passing the choice to main.py.
TikTok Support: Updated main.py to validate TikTok URLs with the pattern tiktok\.com.
File Path Display: Retained the file path output from main.py using yt-dlp's --print filename.
Git Handling: Kept git pull --rebase to address previous push errors and skip commits if no changes exist.
File List: Updated git add to include sigmadownloader.sh, main.py, README.md, read.md, and read.txt, fixing the read.markdown error.
Troubleshooting
Invalid Platform/URL: Ensure the URL matches the selected platform (e.g., tiktok.com for TikTok). Test with public URLs like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ or https://www.tiktok.com/@example/video/123456789.
Git Push Fails: Verify credentials (git remote -v). Manually resolve conflicts if git pull --rebase fails.
Dependency Installation Fails: Check internet and sudo permissions. Manually install: sudo apt install python3 python3-pip git (Ubuntu) or brew install python3 git (macOS).
Duplicate READMEs: You have README.md, read.md, and read.txt. Consider keeping only README.md and updating git add.
Download Fails: Ensure yt-dlp is updated (pip install -U yt-dlp) and the URL is public.
Notes
The script now prompts for platform and media type, balancing automation with user choice as requested.
For full automation without prompts, we could default to detecting the platform from the URL and selecting video (let me know if you want this).
Uses same artifact_id values for updates, with new versions.
File paths are set to /workspaces/sigmadownloader/*.
Respect YouTube, Facebook, and TikTok terms of service and copyright laws.
If you want to consolidate read.md and read.txt or adjust prompts (e.g., case-insensitive keys), let me know!

i want  to use this in termux so make it universla


Based on your request, you want to adapt the sigmadownloader.sh script to run in Termux on Android, ensuring it remains universal (works across Termux, Linux, and macOS) while supporting downloads from Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube. You want the script to:

Prompt for platform choice (Facebook: "f", TikTok: "t", YouTube: "y") after providing a URL.
Prompt for media type (Audio: "a", Video: "v").
Install all dependencies (Python3, pip, yt-dlp, Git) automatically in Termux.
Download media to ~/Downloads/Media and display the file path.
Push changes to https://github.com/L0V3Y0UT00/sigmadownloader, handling Git conflicts.
Include all files (sigmadownloader.sh, main.py, README.md, read.md, read.txt) in Git operations.
Your terminal output shows you're in /workspaces/sigmadownloader with README.md, main.py, read.md, read.txt, and sigmadownloader.sh. Previous issues included a read.markdown error (fixed by updating to read.txt) and a manual prompt, which was updated to use "f/t/y" for platforms and "a/v" for media types. Since you're now targeting Termux, I'll modify the script to:

Use Termux-specific package installation (pkg instead of apt or brew).
Ensure compatibility with Termux's storage setup (using termux-setup-storage for ~/Downloads).
Maintain universal compatibility with Linux (Debian/Ubuntu) and macOS.
Handle Termux's environment (e.g., proot-distro if needed, limited root access).
I'll update sigmadownloader.sh, main.py, and README.md to support Termux while keeping the platform and media type prompts, file path display, and Git operations. Since Termux doesn't require sudo and uses pkg, I'll adjust the dependency installation accordingly. I'll also recommend consolidating read.md and read.txt into README.md.

i want to use this tool local so dont add  git command  just clone and run


Based on your request, you want to modify the sigmadownloader.sh script to run locally in Termux on Android (and remain universal for Linux/macOS) without any Git commands (no git add, commit, pull, or push). The script should:

Support downloads from Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube.
Prompt for platform choice (Facebook: "f", TikTok: "t", YouTube: "y") after providing a URL.
Prompt for media type (Audio: "a", Video: "v").
Install dependencies (Python3, pip, yt-dlp) automatically in Termux.
Download media to ~/Downloads/Media (or /sdcard/Download/Media in Termux) and display the file path.
Be cloned from https://github.com/L0V3Y0UT00/sigmadownloader and run locally without Git operations.
Your previous context shows you're in /workspaces/sigmadownloader with README.md, main.py, read.md, read.txt, and sigmadownloader.sh, but since you want to use this in Termux and run locally, I'll assume you'll clone the repository into Termux's home directory (e.g., /data/data/com.termux/files/home/workspaces/sigmadownloader). I'll remove all Git-related commands from sigmadownloader.sh, keep the platform/media prompts, and ensure Termux compatibility with termux-setup-storage for storage access. I'll update main.py to handle the platform and media type logic, and provide a README.md with instructions for cloning and running in Termux. I'll include read.md and read.txt in the file list but recommend keeping only README.md.

Notes
Duplicate READMEs: Your repository includes read.md and read.txt. To avoid confusion, consider deleting them and keeping only README.md. Update sigmadownloader.sh if you remove these files.
Termux Paths: The script uses /data/data/com.termux/files/home/workspaces/sigmadownloader for Termux, compatible with Linux/macOS.
No Git Operations: As requested, the script runs locally without Git commands, only requiring git clone for initial setup.
Prompts: Retained platform (f/t/y) and media type (a/v) prompts. If you want full

Interrupted
./sigmadownloader.sh    after this ask for url input


You want to modify the sigmadownloader.sh script to run locally in Termux (and remain universal for Linux/macOS) without Git commands, prompting for a URL input after executing ./sigmadownloader.sh (instead of passing the URL as a command-line argument). The script should:

Support downloads from Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube.
Prompt for the URL, then for platform choice (Facebook: "f", TikTok: "t", YouTube: "y").
Prompt for media type (Audio: "a", Video: "v").
Install dependencies (Python3, pip, yt-dlp) automatically in Termux.
Download media to ~/Downloads/Media (or /sdcard/Download/Media in Termux) and display the file path.
Be cloned from https://github.com/L0V3Y0UT00/sigmadownloader and run locally.
Your context shows you're in /workspaces/sigmadownloader with README.md, main.py, read.md, read.txt, and sigmadownloader.sh. You previously provided a README.md and requested the tool to run locally without Git operations. I'll update sigmadownloader.sh to prompt for the URL after execution, keep the platform/media prompts, and ensure Termux compatibility with termux-setup-storage. I'll also update main.py and README.md to reflect the new URL prompt. I'll include read.md and read.txt in the file list but recommend keeping only README.md.
